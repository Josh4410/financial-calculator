| Credit Multiplier |   Formula: 1 / reserve_ratio |
| Simple Interest | Formula: I = PV * r * n |
| Future Value of single payment (Simple Interest) | Formula: FV = PV(1 + r*n) |
| Present Value of single payment (Simple Interest) | Formula: PV = FV / (1 + r*n) |
| Future Value (Compound Interest) | Formula: FV = PV(1+r)^n |
| Present Value (Compound Interest)| Formula: PV = FV / (1+r)^n |
| Future Value (Multiple Compounding) | Formula: FV = PV*(1+(r/m))^(m*n) |
| Present Value (Multiple Compounding) | Formula: PV = FV / (1+(r/m))^(m*n) |
| Future Value (Continuous Compounding) | Formula: FV = PV*e^(r*n) |
| Effective Interest Rate | Formula: re = (1+(r/m))^(m*n) - 1 |
| Unknown Interest Rate | Formula: r = ((FV/PV)^(1/n))-1 |
| Unknown Time Period | Formula: n = ln(FV/PV)/ln(1+r) |
| Future and Present Value of Annuity | Formulas: FVA = PMT((((1+r)^n)-1)/r) PVA = PMT((1-(1+r)^(-n))/r) |
| Future and Present Value of Annuity Due | Formulas: FV = PMT*((((1+r)^n)-1)/r)*(1+r) PV = PMT((1-(1+r)^(-n))/r)*(1+r) |
| Bond Price | Formula: P = PMT*((1-(1+r)^(-n))/r)+(F/((1+r)^n)) |
| Present Value of Constant Perpetuity |  Formula: PV = C / r |
| Present Value of Growing Perpetuity | Formula: PV = C / (r-g) |
| Capitalization Rate |Formula: r = Net Income / V |
| Capitalization Value | Formula: V = Net Income / r |
